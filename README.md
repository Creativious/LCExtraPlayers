# LCExtraPlayers

Allows up to ten players to play on Lethal Company.

Probably will have some bugs as I could've missed another hardcoded value


Game Updates will likely break this mod as I'm patching the raw assembly using CIL.


Requires BepInEx to function.

The mod goes in "Lethal Company/BepInEx/patchers/"
